"""Repo guards that need no cluster, so they can run on every PR.

Each check here exists because the defect it screens for was SHIPPING in this
repository, not because it seemed plausible. The three were found on 2026-10-29
and reported across the Krateo blueprint repos; `aruba-provider-kog` hit all
three independently and contributed the original implementations.

Every check asserts it can detect a known-bad input AND that it does not
false-positive on a known-good one, before it trusts its own sweep. A screen
that reports "all clear" without proving it can catch a known-bad case is just
a function that returns false. That is not hypothetical here: a sweep for the
removed auth-bridge matched `auth-bridge` and `authBridge` but not "auth
bridge" with a space, reported clean, and had missed ten prose mentions
including the docs landing page. An INCOMPLETE pattern fails exactly like a
dead one.
